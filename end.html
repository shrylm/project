    <p>Mom and dad were so busy decorating that they didn’t see the time passing. It is now 5AM. They go to bed to try to get a little rest before the boy awakes… but he’s already up! He runs to the living room, and discovers the lights, decorations, and gifts. He screams with excitement: “MOM! DAD! Look – Santa was here!”. Despite being tired, his parents are happy – it was worth it!</p>
